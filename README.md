# Regression-and-Classification-Algorithms-from-scratch
Had some fun coding some known classification and regression models from scratch.
Included some explanation to illustrate functionalities of each, and experiemented with different variables to illustrate characteristics

NOTE: This was done purely for the purpose of exploration so I cannot guarentee that there are 0 bugs/errors. 
These were also not written at a presentation-level, so stylistically it will not be the most beautiful piece of code you've ever seen.

Regression Projects include:
1. Least Squares
2. MAP (Poly)
3. Gaussian and Sigmoid Basis Functions
4. Full Bayesian Inference
5. Bayesian Sequential Learning
6. Predictive Distribution
7. Gaussian Processes

Classification Projects include:
1. Least Squares
2. Predictive Distribution
3. Gaussian Processes
